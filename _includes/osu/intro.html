This workshop template and the lessons have been developed using <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> materials. 
  However, this is not a Software Carpentry workshop. The Matlab lesson that we will teach here is a shortened and modified version of the original
  <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/"> Programming with Matlab </a> lesson from <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>.
