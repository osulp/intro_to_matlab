<h4>This is an introductory workshop to Matlab for beginners. We will follow a shortened and modified version of the Software Carpentry lesson <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/">Programming with Matlab</a> that can be found in <a href="https://osulp.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/"> https://osulp.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/</a>. We will talk about reading data with Matlab and organize it in variables, vectors and matrices.  We will perform some basic operations on the data (averages) and will create some visualizations and save them. We will talk about writing Matlab scripts and functions, and we will write loops and conditional statements. </h4>

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.

  <h3>Matlab</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">Matlab</a> is a programming language
    that is powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. Matlab is not free, so you will need access to a Matlab license to participate in the workshop. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  If you are an OSU faculty, staff or student, you have two options:
  <ol>
    <li> You can install MATLAB with an OSU license following the instructions in    <a href="https://is.oregonstate.edu/service/software/matlab">https://is.oregonstate.edu/service/software/matlab</a>. <strong>We strongly recommend this option for this workshop.</strong></li>
    <li> You can access MATLAB without having to install it in your own computer using <a href="https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/citrix">Citrix.</a></li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  More information about installing MATLAB for this workshop can be found in the <a href="https://osulp.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/setup.html">Setup section of the lesson</a>.
